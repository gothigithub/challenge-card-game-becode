"""In player.py creat a class Player that contains these attributes:

cards which is a list of Card. (you will need to import Card from card.py). In a real card game, this is equivalent to the cards that the player has in his hands.
turn_count which is an int starting a 0.
number_of_cards which is an int starting at 0.
history which is a list of Card that will contain all the cards played by the player.
And some methods:

play() that will:
randomly pick a Card in cards.
Add the Card to the Player's history.
Print: {PLAYER_NAME} {TURN_COUNT} played: {CARD_NUMBER} {CARD_SYMBOL_ICON}.
return the Card.

Create a Deck class that contains:

An attribute cards which is going to contain a list of instances of Card.

A fill_deck() method that will fill cards with a complete card game
 (an instance of 'A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K' for each possible symbol [♥, ♦, ♣, ♠]).
  Your deck should contain 52 cards at the end.
A shuffle() method that will shuffle all the list of cards.
A distribute() that will take a list of Player as parameter and will distribute the cards
 evenly between all the players.
